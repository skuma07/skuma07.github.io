### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was one of my first and one of my favorite labs because it was one to really solidify my interest in Computer Science. In this lab I had to create a program that solves a quadratic equation. This lab was to help me practice and understand how variable initialization and arithmetic in C++ works. With math being my favorite subject, I really enjoyed making this program since sometimes I personally make use of this program in order to check my answers whenever I solve quadratic equations.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 is my second favorite lab because it challenged me the most. In this lab I had to write a Blackjack program that tested my new knowledge of for loops, comlpex if statements, and command line arguments more than any lab before it. Successfully completing this lab validated my competency in learning Computer Science, since at the time it was a tough lab for me to complete.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 is my third favorite lab because I feel like the complexity of the work I was doing scaled up in this lab compared to any of the other labs I did before it. This is because this lab was the first in which I was working with multiple files. The overall program I made was simple, it just calculated the area of a rectangle; however, this lab was an effective introduction in teaching me the benefits of using multiple files for a program.
